# UK Household Food Shopping
A machine learning analysis using Python and Tableau to analyse income and spending on food data.

## Project Overview
**Motivation** : Poor diet within the UK is a public health issue and the UK is ranked as one of the worst in Europe for levels of obesity, particularly among children. A [study in the journal Public Health Nutrition](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/household-availability-of-ultraprocessed-foods-and-obesity-in-nineteen-european-countries/D63EF7095E8EFE72BD825AFC2F331149) showed that families buy more 'ultra-processed' food than other European countries; with these products accounting for more than half of all UK family food purchases. ‘Ultra-processed’ food - food made in a factory with industrial ingredients and additives you wouldn’t find in your kitchen - bears little resemblance to the fruit, vegetables, meat or fish used to cook a fresh meal at home. Could these products be driving the rise in obesity? 

**Objective** : This project will investigate if there are any relationships between ‘ultra-processed’ foods, household expenditure and obesity. 
.

**Scope** : This project will focus on the UK and look at data from 2015 up to 2020.

### Data Sets
The following data sets were used during the project:
1. [CDC Influenza Deaths](https://github.com/eekevall/Preparing-for-Influenza-Season-Excel-Analysis/blob/main/Influenza_Season_Datasets/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx)
2. [Census Population Transformed 202101](https://github.com/eekevall/Preparing-for-Influenza-Season-Excel-Analysis/blob/main/Influenza_Season_Datasets/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv) - replaced in the analysis by the New Population 2010_17 below
3. [New Population Data 2010_17](https://github.com/eekevall/Preparing-for-Influenza-Season-Excel-Analysis/blob/main/Influenza_Season_Datasets/New_Population_Data_2010_17.xlsx)
4. [CDC Influenza Visits](https://github.com/eekevall/Preparing-for-Influenza-Season-Excel-Analysis/blob/main/Influenza_Season_Datasets/CDC_Influenza_Visits.xlsx) 
5. [Vaccination Coverage among Health Care Personnel](https://github.com/eekevall/Preparing-for-Influenza-Season-Excel-Analysis/blob/main/Influenza_Season_Datasets/Vaccination_Coverage_among_Health_Care_Personnel.csv)
6. [Influenza Vaccination Coverage for All Ages 6 Months](https://github.com/eekevall/Preparing-for-Influenza-Season-Excel-Analysis/blob/main/Influenza_Season_Datasets/Influenza_Vaccination_Coverage_for_All_Ages__6__Months_.csv)
7. [CDC Hospitalisation Rates](https://github.com/eekevall/Preparing-for-Influenza-Season-Excel-Analysis/blob/main/Influenza_Season_Datasets/CDC_Hospitalisation_Rates.csv)

### Data Analysis Tasks
* Formulating a research hypothesis and sourcing the right data
* Data profiling, quality, transformation and integration
* Statistical analyses and hypothesis testing
* Consolidating analytical insights and creating visualisations
* Communicating research findings and insights

### Tools
The analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel and Tableau.

### Hypothesis<br>
**If states have a high proportion of vaccinated health care workers (nurses, physician assistants and doctors), then fewer vulnerable people will develop serious complications and end up in the hospital.**
